     overview
</div>

<div class = "bodytext">
i use my camera and iphone to take pictures. for my camera, i'm practicing shooting manually and editing with photoshop (and lightroom, once it starts working for me.) i have a photography site / page coming soon for my camera pictures and my <a href = "https://vsco.co/sharvanijha">vsco</a> hosts all my iphone pictures deemed alright for the public.

<div class = "bodytitle">
    shoots, etc
</div>

<div class = "bodytext">
    i can do photography (most comfortable with event photography, can try other things at discounted rate) and while i do charge, this includes the cost of me taking as many group photos as you'd like (within a reasonable amount of time) before and after the event as well as consistently edited photos of your event and any extra group / portrait photos taken immediately before or after. contact me at sharvanijha at ucla dot edu if you're interested in having me do photography for your event!

    why photography?

    <div class = "bodytext">
     i'm not great at it! but i want to learn and i want to get better and i'm not quite sure how to put it nicely into words, but it just feels so satisfying to get a good shot that turns out exactly as beautifully as i see something in real life or in my head.
