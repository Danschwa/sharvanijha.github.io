there's a reason my hands are stained black
</div>

<div class = "bodytext">
i love to write. i have a few too many diaries / journals stuffed in my dorm room right now, and i've dabbled in fiction, prose, persuasive essays, reflections, and the occasional poetry. i still continue to write (a lot!) - when college is in full swing, i usually spare a few minutes every several days to write the especially good or especially bad, and any reminders i want my future self to have as i inevitably read words i barely remember writing two weeks later. when college isn't in full swing, i'm writing LOTS of drafts in medium / wordpress, and then heavily debating whether it's something i want the public to see.</p>

my fourteen year old self once phrased it as "i bleed words", and i'll stick with that description because it thus excuses the ink stains that cover my hands and fingers more often that i like to admit.</p>

some of my favorite words include: altruistic.

published stuff

<div class = "bodytext">
i still can't decide between medium and wordpress, but my more recent / relevant to the general viewer work is on medium so i'd suggest trying one's luck there. </p>

some topics i like to touch / peruse on as of right now: intersectional feminism (emphasis on the intersectional), pushing for diversity (especially in tech), space, anything that allows for an emphasis on sun / moon dichotomies in relationships because - not to be dramatic - that is the peak description of any relationship involving opposing forces / dynamics.</p>
