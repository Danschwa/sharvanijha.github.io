i work for ucla elfin. simply put, i tell the satellite what to do when and i'm part of a team working to develop software to make this task of commanding the satellite as easy as possible

tech is cool! hence why i'm majoring in it.

  i'm a second year computer science major at ucla. i'm currently having fun checking out the fields of machine learning and web development.

artificial intelligence

    i have this SUPER fun habit of getting really interested in certain topics and then sometimes forgetting i was interested in them. case in point: i was reading my journal entries from senior year, and found a line about how excited i was for ai's potential to impact the field of astrophysics. upon coming to college, however, it took me two quarters to rediscover my interest in ai.</p>

    anyways, fast forward to winter quarter of my freshman year! i was going with the flow in my classes, but had yet to think beyond the stuff i was learning and really consider what i wanted to do with computer science in my career and what specific passion / application was driving my interest in learning these skills. and then the news dropped dropped that google had managed to detect a bunch of exoplanets using deep learning, and i had a very clich√© but nevertheless AHA moment - this was it! this was my specific interest!</p>

    in a course i'd taken earlier in the school year called "life in the universe", my professor had talked about how difficult it was to detect exoplanets and how we probably wouldn't see much improvement in that field. but here ai / ml was, changing the game and making the impossible a reality right in front of my eyes. 

    that was the moment i knew i wanted to learn about ai - i wanted to understand the mechanisms that were powering these kinds of new insights into the world around us. so to continue learning about ai and try and help others learn (something i like doing) i joined acm ai as an officer in the spring of 2018. it's super fun to teach workshops, help out / take part in projects, and spearhead outreach initiatives, and i am so excited to see what the club will do this year!

    web dev! design is cool and important!
</div>

<div class = "bodytext">
    i've always had strong opinions about things being pretty, but it wasn't till i got to college that i realized that actually had value. from making edits of my favorite tv characters to being VERY particular about my playlist covers on 8tracks to re-editing my blog theme every two weeks since i was 14, i've cared about the user experience for a very long time without ever realizing it, constantly thinking about what kind of message i want my content to convey, both implicitly and explicitly. this was what sparked my interest in web dev and design in general - if you have a good product but it's difficult / impossible for people to use or learn about, then what's the point?</p>

    i'm still pretty new to the field and have a lot to learn in terms of both web dev and design, but i do what i can to learn in my free time, from designing a lot of websites to coding a few of those designs to playing around on photoshop + xd in my free time to surfing behance just to see what cool things people are making. i also took a human-computer interaction course and i LOVED it - i can't wait to hopefully continue a more formal introduction to these topics which i find fascinating!
